##Creat a cinfig.txt file, this configure fiile contains softwares needed and their path. The config.txt should be in the same folder with output file.
##As the programme will run for several days, so we need to use the command of screen and qlogin to run it. Be aware that we can use any of the blacklace more than 6 as we need more memrry to run it. 



screen -a
ssh blacklace08
or qlogin -pe smp 20 -l virtual_free=1.1G

# use one reference 
 #java -Xmx6000m -jar RealPhy_v112.jar . /home/fanron/programs/RealPhy/out/ -treeBuilder 2 -ref1 JR2
 #but Java always run out of memory. so connect to a node and give 20g(or 20G) of memeory to the job.

qlogin -pe smp 20 -l virtual_free=1G
#using JR2 genome as reference
java -Xmx25g -jar RealPhy_v112.jar . /home/fanron/programs/RealPhy/out/ -treeBuilder 2 -treeOptions boot.txt -ref JR2
#using Ls17 genome as reference
java -Xmx25g -jar RealPhy_v112.jar . /home/fanron/programs/RealPhy/out/ -treeBuilder 2 -ref Ls17

##Specify the bootstraps
###first, need to creat a txt file (bootstrapt.txt), and provide command line parameters to RAxML in the first line the text file, save it. 
###then run the command again to get a new tree.( This step is actually not necessary)
qlogin -pe smp 20 -l virtual_free=1.1G
java -Xmx25g -jar RealPhy_v112.jar . /home/fanron/programs/RealPhy/out/ -treeBuilder 2 -treeOptions bootstrapt.txt -ref JR2
java -Xmx25g -jar RealPhy_v112.jar . /home/fanron/programs/RealPhy/out/ -treeBuilder 2 -treeOptions bootstrapt.txt -ref Ls17
##Run this command in your (each) output folder because the file of polymorphisms_move.phy is in the output folder. ##This is to generate a bootstraped tree with the output file named RAxML_bipartitions.out2
/home/hulinm/local/src/standard-RAxML/raxmlHPC-AVX -s polymorphisms_move.phy -n out2 -m GTRGAMMA -f a -x $RANDOM -N 100 -p 12345



# use more than one reference (Note: this will need more memory as there are two references)

#java -Xmx6000m -jar RealPhy_v112.jar . /home/fanron/programs/RealPhy/out/ -treeBuilder 2 -ref1 JR2 -ref2 Ls17 -merge
