##Creat a cinfig.txt file, this configure fiile contains softwares needed and their path. The config.txt should be in the same folder with output file.
##As the programme will run for several days, so we need to use the command of screen and qlogin to run it. Be aware that we can use any of the blacklace more than 6 as we need more memrry to run it. 



screen -a
ssh blacklace08
or qlogin -pe smp 20 -l virtual_free=1.1G

# use one reference 
# used this command:
 #java -Xmx6000m -jar RealPhy_v112.jar . /home/fanron/programs/RealPhy/out/ -treeBuilder 2 -ref1 JR2
 #but Java always run out of memory. so connect to a node and give 10g(or 10G) of memeory to the job.

qlogin -pe smp 20 -l virtual_free=1.1G
#using JR2 genome as reference
java -Xmx25g -jar RealPhy_v112.jar . /home/fanron/programs/RealPhy/out/ -treeBuilder 2 -ref JR2
#using Ls17 genome as reference
java -Xmx25g -jar RealPhy_v112.jar . /home/fanron/programs/RealPhy/out/ -treeBuilder 2 -ref Ls17


# use more than one reference (Note: this will need more memory as there are two references)

#java -Xmx6000m -jar RealPhy_v112.jar . /home/fanron/programs/RealPhy/out/ -treeBuilder 2 -ref1 JR2 -ref2 Ls17 -merge
