#  Quantification of gene model expression


Expression was determined for aligned reads against predcited gene models using
cufflinks:

```bash
for Alignment in $(ls alignment/repeat_masked/12008PDA_accurate/accepted_hits.bam); do
Gff=gene_pred/codingquary1/V.dahliae/12008/final/final_genes_appended.gff3
OutDir=$(dirname $Alignment)
mkdir -p $OutDir/fpkm
ProgDir=/home/fanron/git_repos/tools/seq_tools/RNAseq
qsub $ProgDir/sub4_cufflinks.sh $Gff $Alignment
# cufflinks -p 8 -o $OutDir/fpkm -G $Gff $Alignment
